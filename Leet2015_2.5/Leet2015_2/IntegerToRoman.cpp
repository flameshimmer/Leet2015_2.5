//Given an integer, convert it to a roman numeral.
//
//Input is guaranteed to be within the range from 1 to 3999.
//
//Symbols are placed from left to right in order of value, starting with the largest.However, 
// in a few specific cases, [2] to avoid four characters being repeated in succession(such as IIII or XXXX)
// these can be reduced using subtractive notation as follows : [3][4]
//
//the numeral I can be placed before V and X to make 4 units(IV) and 9 units(IX) respectively
//X can be placed before L and C to make 40 (XL)and 90 (XC)respectively
//C can be placed before D and M to make 400 (CD)and 900 (CM)according to the same pattern[5]
//
//An example using the above rules would be 1904 : this is composed of 1 (one thousand), 
//9 (nine hundreds), 0 (zero tens), and 4 (four units).To write the Roman numeral, each of the non-zero 
// digits should be treated separately.Thus 1, 000 = M, 900 = CM, and 4 = IV.Therefore, 1904 is MCMIV.
//
//Symbol Value
//I	1
//V	5
//X	10
//L	50
//C	100
//D	500
//M	1000
